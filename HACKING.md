# Hacking

Additions and extensions are welcome!

I do request that any code submitted be:

1. Easy to read. I know this is a WIN32 project, but try to keep it as readable and easy to follow as possible.
2. Following our chosen convention for [coding style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_Linux_kernel). Notable exceptions are the limit on line length and tab-stop. If we're using tabs, I don't care what tab-stop setting you use (I use 4). Line length is of course as long as necessary (don't prematurely break lines), but also see #1.
3. Follow what's laid out in the documentation. If the documentation is counter-productive, please submit a modification to the documentation. That way we can discuss any questions that may arise about the code. It also keeps the whole project in the same direction.
